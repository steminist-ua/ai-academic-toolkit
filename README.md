# AI Academic Toolkit

This repository contains a set of resources developed by **Anastasiia Iskandarova-Mala (steminist-ua)** to support responsible, transparent, and effective use of generative AI in higher education.  
It combines policy, tools, and experimental assistants that help students and educators integrate AI in a meaningful way.

## 📑 Academic AI Policy

A comprehensive policy framework for academic use of generative AI in university teaching and learning.  
It defines principles, allowed practices, declaration requirements, and evaluation mechanisms.

- **Summary:** The policy views AI as a *cognitive partner* rather than a replacement. Students are required to declare AI use, demonstrate substantial modifications, and reflect critically on generated outputs.  
- **Languages:**  
  - [Policy on the Academic Use of Generative Artificial Intelligence in University Courses](./POLICY.md)  
  - [Політика академічного використання інструментів генеративного штучного інтелекту у навчальних курсах викладача](./POLICY_UA.md)

## 📝 RAID-G — Responsible AI Declaration Generator

**RAID-G** (*Responsible AI Declaration Generator*) is a web-based tool to help students generate structured AI use declarations in line with the policy.  

- **Description:** Provides an easy-to-use form with dropdowns, quick-insert chips (Refactoring, Boilerplate, Tests, etc.), and support for both English and Ukrainian. Generates ready-to-use Markdown declarations for assignments.  
- **Live version:** [steminist-ua.github.io/ai-academic-toolkit/raid-g/](https://steminist-ua.github.io/ai-academic-toolkit/raid-g/)

## 🎓 AI Teaching Assistant (in development)

An experimental AI-powered assistant designed for educational purposes. Unlike generic AI chatbots, this assistant is tailored to the needs of higher education:

- Helps **evaluate student work** fairly and transparently.  
- Provides **code refactoring advice** and suggests improvements.  
- Answers **conceptual questions** and explains theory.  
- Acts as a **learning facilitator**, focusing on skill-building and understanding, *not* just giving final answers.  

This assistant aims to embody the philosophy of the policy: guiding students to think critically, collaborate, and learn responsibly with AI.
