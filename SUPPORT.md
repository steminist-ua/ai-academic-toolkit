# Getting Support

Thanks for your interest in the **AI Academic Toolkit**. I want contributors, educators, and students to get help quickly and keep improving the project together. Below are the preferred support channels. Please pick the option that best matches your scenario.

## Questions About the Policy or Toolkit

- Open a GitHub **Discussion** (category *Q&A*) if you have conceptual questions about the academic AI policy, the RAID-G generator, or the teaching assistant prototype.
- If your question references a specific file in the policy site, include the page path (for example `src/app/appendices/references/page.mdx`) so we can respond faster.

## Bugs or Feature Requests

- Search the [issue tracker](https://github.com/steminist-ua/ai-academic-toolkit/issues) to see whether the problem has already been reported.
- If not, create a new issue using the appropriate template. Provide:
  - steps to reproduce,
  - expected vs actual behaviour,
  - environment details (OS, browser, Node.js version).
- For feature ideas, explain the teaching scenario you are trying to address so we can align the roadmap with real classroom needs.

## Security or Privacy Concerns

Please do **not** open a public issue if you have found a security vulnerability or a privacy risk in the tools.  
Instead, email **mala@steminist.com.ua** with the subject line `SECURITY: <summary>` and include:

- affected component and version,
- steps to reproduce,
- potential impact.

You will receive an acknowledgement within 72 hours and coordinated disclosure will be arranged if required.

## Community and Collaboration

- For collaboration proposals (research, curriculum pilots, localization), send an email to **mala@steminist.com.ua** with `COLLABORATION` in the subject line.
- Follow updates and share feedback via the [project wiki](https://github.com/steminist-ua/ai-academic-toolkit/wiki) or Discussions to keep knowledge accessible to everyone.

Thanks for helping us build responsible, transparent, and human-centered AI practices in higher education!
